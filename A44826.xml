            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Pſalm is thought by ſome Interpreters to be pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>David</hi> after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God had appeared to him, and deſigned the place where he ſhould build an Altar at preſent, and where afterward the Temple was to be built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> pointing, as it were, to the place which the Lord had choſen to cauſe his Name to dwell there; as it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.11. This they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe think was after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been afflicted with three years Famine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. and with three dayes Peſtilence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. which might be the reaſon of thoſe words in the ſecond verſe, as <hi>Junius</hi> concludes, <hi>Out of Sion the perfection of beauty God hath ſhined:</hi> For now it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by God himſelf, that the light of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30252:6"/>
his favour is reſtored to his People, after the darkneſs and calamities of former times were paſſed over. The Pſalmiſt takes this occaſion to inform his holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how they ought to carry on his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by not reſting in the external, and ceremonial, but rather attending to the moral, and ſpiritual part thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. the former in compariſon of this latter, being in a ſenſe to be rejected, and laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide without it, as inſignificant in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God, if it be not accompanied with the other: And hereupon is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion made unto the wicked in the 16 <hi>verſe,</hi> to tell them, that they can expect no benefit by attendance upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Worſhip of God, ſo long as they hate to be reformed in their lives, which the covenant of God principally requires: The more to affect this ſort of men, the Pſalmiſt perſonates them in their wicked words and works, from <hi>ver.</hi> 17, to the 22d. where he ſeeks to recal them from their ſinful wayes, and bring them back to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by the fear of Gods inevitable wrath in that verſe, and then ſhuts up the whole diſcourſe of the Pſalm by a ſolemn
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30252:6"/>
Epiphonema, in the laſt verſe, conſiſting of two parts: in the firſt of which is ſhewn how acceptable to God is ſpiritual Worſhip, he that ſacrificeth praiſe glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me; in the latter is ſeen how profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to man is moral obedience; <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright will I ſhew the Salvation of God:</hi> Theſe are the laſt words of the Pſalm, but are not of leaſt moment and importance, for they contain the ſum and ſubſtance of the whole Pſalm foregoing.</p>
                  <p>The Textual difficulties in this laſt clauſe of the verſe, are not above three or four, and in a few more words will be all cleared.</p>
                  <p>If it be enquired therefore: <hi>Firſt,</hi> what is meant by the Converſation? It is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that according to the Original word, nothing is intended therein, but the way or courſe of a mans life, according to the Metaphor uſual in the Scriptures, where a mans works or the courſe and frame of his life is compared to a way or path that leads from one place to another; with this difference only, that as there are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30252:7"/>
many places in this lower world whither men may repair, ſo there are many paths or wayes that directly lead thereunto; but as to the other World, there are but two places to which all our actions tend, and to one of which they will certainly bring all that perſiſt therein, <hi>viz.</hi> either Heaven or Hell, Life or Death, Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: ſuch as are our works here, will be our reward hereafter. The way which we have deſigned to our ſelves, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in, will certainly in the iſſue bring us to the good which is promiſed, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil threatned in the Word of God. There is no other word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to expreſs our converſation but this of our way. In the <hi>Greek Teſtament,</hi> there is a word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly anſwers Converſation; which comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Verſari huc, illuc,</hi> as Horſe-men in a Battle, that turn this way, and that way, as occaſion ſerves: yet ſtill aims to carry on the main deſign at firſt intended. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, he was made all things to all men, that he might by all means ſave ſome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20, 21, 22. So muſt every Chriſtian, in a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30252:7"/>
ſenſe, ſhape his courſe according as the Wind and Current of providence ſhifts, or ſets this way or that way; by doing, and ſuffering, bearing, and forbearing keep on in the way of obedience; joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſdom of the Serpent, with the innocence of the Dove: or as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Phraſe is, when they paſs through difficult and dangerous paſſages on either hand, aloof for one, and bear up for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſtill keeping on in the direct way that leads to the Haven of reſt and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is it to order our way aright?</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew word properly ſignifies to put, diſpoſe: <hi>Mercer</hi> renders the Word <hi>Arte, curâ, &amp; ordine ponere, aut diſponere;</hi> and therefore it is fitly rendred in our Tranſlation, order aright. It is uſed to expreſs a <hi>ſingularis obſervantia,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence either to the acts either of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind. There is need of a great deal of skill and artifice, as well as care and induſtry in the ordering the frame of our lives: Not to ſeek the firſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30252:8"/>
that ſhould be left to the ſecond place: as our Saviour bids us <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of heaven, and the righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> Mat. 6.33. He that ſeeks other things in the firſt place, and leaves the care of his Salvation, with <hi>Felix,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> to a more convenient ſeaſon, doth not order his way aright, for that will bring him to an ill end at laſt. Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> ordered his way aright to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ten Tribes, but quite wrong as to the Kingdom of God, when all his care was to walk in the way of <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Idolatry, but took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with all his heart, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.31.</p>
                  <p>This ordering the way aright may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a threefold act of a Chriſtian: <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the mind, to judge and apprehend, what is the right, or the wrong way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto life. To diſcern what is the principal thing to be deſired. <hi>Secondly,</hi> an act of the affection to embrace, deſire that way which is the moſt neceſſary and excellent. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An act of the Will,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30252:8"/>
for purpoſe and reſolution to purſue that which is in it ſelf moſt neceſſary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and that will I ſeek after,</hi> Pſal. 27.4. And our Saviour tells us, <hi>There is but one thing neceſſary,</hi> and he commends <hi>Mary</hi> for making her choice of that, and not cumbring her ſelf with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that were not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is that Salvation of God which they ſhall ſee, who order their way aright? By ſalvation unto the people of God under the diſpenſation of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, was generally ſignified, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or deliverance from any temporal evil that at any time they were preſſed withal with obtaining the contrary good. Yet ſo as thereby, in a ſpiritual, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime ſenſe was ſignified, Deliverance from all evil both of ſin and judgment, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or eternal, which they had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obnoxious unto by their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the obtaining the favour of God towards them in the peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the good land, which they were poſſeſſed of, till they came to obtain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30252:9"/>
happineſs of Gods Kingdom in the other World, of which the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a ſtanding type and ſhadow. So Salvation is moſt frequently taken in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; The obtaining of all that good both temporal and eternal, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to make any people or perſon, proſperous and happy, with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from all the evil which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This is called Gods Salvation, not only as that which is in it ſelf moſt eminent, or excellent; as excellent Cedars, are called Cedars of God: but becauſe, 1. It is a Salvation which God only can give: as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, elſewhere, <hi>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man,</hi> Pſal. 60. And ſo he ſpeaks of looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Hills, from which cometh his help. And it is Gods ſalvation which his People ſeek for; and therefore <hi>David</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtiles God <hi>his Salvation and his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> 2. A Salvation which God will give: For in the Hebrew it is, <hi>I will cauſe him to ſee the ſalvation of God,</hi> which is to note the effectualneſs of this promiſe:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30252:9"/>
though it may ſeem never ſo improbable, and almoſt impoſſible; yet God will make them that order their way aright, to ſee his ſalvation at ſuch a time. 3. It is alſo more emphatically expreſſed in the third perſon; <hi>Such a one ſhall be made to ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> It was a time of great extremity in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in <hi>Jehoram's</hi> time: Death as well as Dearth was come upon them: There is a word of Salvation comes from the Lord by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; which ſpeaks of great plenty that ſhould be forthwith in <hi>Samaria;</hi> God made it good, but the unbelieving Lord, though he ſaw it with his eyes, yet he never felt the good of Salvation, becauſe he did not order his way aright, to give Glory to the God of Iſrael, by believing the word which he ſpake by his Prophet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Junius</hi> renders the word <hi>See,</hi> by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſo the ſence of ſeeing, which is the moſt noble, active of all the ſenſes, is frequently put for feeling, enjoying, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; as it is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.6. where the unbelieving wretches that truſt in an arm of Fleſh, whoſe hearts depart away from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30252:10"/>
God, are ſaid to be curſed; and ſhall be left like the Heath in the Deſart, <hi>that ſhall not ſee when God cometh.</hi> If we obſerve the conduct of Providence in the former as well as in the preſent age, we ſhall find the people of God often reduced to thoſe ſtreights that none but the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could grant them Salvation from.</p>
                  <p>The words thus opened, do very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and of themſelves run into this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or point of Doctrine:
<q>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> A right ordered Converſation is the direct and neceſſary way for any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or perſon to obtain Gods Salvation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beſt improvement of this Doctrine will be, 1. By ſhewing wherein conſiſts a well ordered Converſation. 2. By lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the ſalvation which ſuch ſhall ſee. 3. Confirming this truth by ſuch inſtances, and reaſons, as may be found in our experience. 4. By anſwering ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as look another way. 5. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch Application, as the nature of the truth requires.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30252:10"/>1. For the firſt of theſe, there are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things neceſſary to a well ordered Converſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A good beginning, or a ſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within. He that doth not begin well, will never end well, if he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alter his courſe. For he that ſets out in a wrong way, the longer he continues therein, is gone further from the deſired end (if Gods Salvation be that which was aimed at) then at his firſt entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. For ſo Chriſt tells the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that their proſelytes are twofold more the Children of Hell, than they were before. They muſt not ſet out in the Fleſh, that ever intend or hope to end in the Spirit. A good Tree is abſolutely needful to good fruit; and ſo is a good heart unto a good life. If the Fountain be not clean, it will never ſend forth good Water in its Streams: for as <hi>James tells us, The ſame Fountain can never ſend forth ſweet water and bitter.</hi> The heart muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before the words and works will be found pure and perfect; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaks,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30252:11"/>
the hands work, and the feet walks: the Index in a Clock points to thoſe figures without, that the wheels within move un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The heart is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> in this little World, that carries all the other <hi>Orbs</hi> of the <hi>thoughts, affections, ſenſes,</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> along with it. Since the <hi>Fall,</hi> the frame of every mans heart is bent to evil, <hi>only to evil, and that continuully;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole frame of nature muſt be changed and turned about, before any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made toward this ſalvation of God. There muſt be a gracious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inclination of the <hi>Will,</hi> whereby it comes to be determined to well-doing, before any hope of Salvation will be brought about: For as <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith well, It is the heart or will that is the proper ſeat and ſubject of virtue: Becauſe, <q>
                        <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas, nec a ſe nec a ratione ſufficienter determinata eſt ad bonum, ergo opus habet ſua propra diſpoſitione ad recte agendum.</hi> i. e. the <hi>Will</hi> is neither of it ſelf, nor by by the force of reaſon ſufficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined unto good, therefore it ſtands in need of a proper diſpoſition of its own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30252:11"/>
to incline it to well-doing.</q> Take any of the children of men of the moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly natural diſpoſition, let him be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by the moſt likely way of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, both by precepts of vertue and good examples leading thereunto. Lay before him as many Arguments, Reaſons as may be of force to convince the moſt obſtinate mind, and obdurate heart, ſo as he ſhall be forced to acknowledge that the precept is holy, juſt and good: the way directly tending unto life; yet till the heart be changed and over-poured by a work of ſupernatural grace, the life will alwayes be found barren of any good fruit, void of holineſs, and ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: yea many times none are found more vitious in their lives than ſuch as have had the beſt advantage for piety, by their education? None ever proved worſe Children than thoſe who have had the beſt of men for their Parents, till their hearts were changed by the power of divine Grace, if ever they attained thereunto. Of which <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30252:12"/>
Ammon</hi> and <hi>Abſolom,</hi> in the families of <hi>Abram, Iſaac, Jacob, Eli, David; Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Gerſhom,</hi> Judg. 18.30. the Grand-child of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Ring-leader of Idolatry among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the like may be ſaid of <hi>Joaſh</hi> under the tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jehojeda.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Heathens, Nero</hi> the <hi>Emperour of Rome</hi> was bred up under <hi>Seneca</hi> the beſt of <hi>Heathen Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers;</hi> yet of all the Heathen Rulers, none ever proved more prodigiouſly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Thus as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth earthy, the ſecond man is of the Lord from Heaven.</hi> As is the earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are heavenly. Till there be a change wrought in the heart, that doth imprint the image of the heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Soul, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an earthly Converſation, until we become born again from Heaven, it will never be ſaid truly, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be the reaſon why the Scripture lays ſo much weight upon the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30252:12"/>
uprightneſs, and obedience of the heart: <hi>My Son give me thy heart; And above all keepings keep the heart, for out of it are the iſſues of life,</hi> that is, the great wheel that carries all other powers and faculties along with it. And if the heart be not changed by the infuſing a new diſpoſition, though you may by force imprint another moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the preſent, yet it will not hold long, unleſs it have a new nature ſtamped upon it. It will be but as a ſtone that may be by Engines forced upward, or as water heated by the fire, which retains their innate qualities, to which they will ſoon return again, and to that place of their center. Therefore he that would have his way ſet right, muſt begin with his heart, and get that changed, and put into a right frame, and then all the reſt will follow. He that made the heart at firſt, and formeth the ſpirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, muſt alſo make the heart anew, and renew a right ſpirit within every man, muſt renew it again: This is the ſenſe of the Church of God in all ages as to this article of Religion, <hi>Turn us O God of our</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:30252:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Salvation, and then we ſhall be ſaved, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> is at laſt convinced that he cannot be turned unleſs God will pleaſe to turn him. This turn in the heart neceſſarily includes Faith in God, through the Lord Jeſus, by whoſe merit alone Salvation is to be obtained. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing required to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ordered aright, is a ſuitable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration conſtantly proceeding therefrom; which will be neceſſarily required in the ſeveral actions of our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>changes</hi> that <hi>paſs over us:</hi> for though our way be but one in the general, as to the main ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof, yet there are ſeveral parts of the ſame; like ſo many diſtinct bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the <hi>Trees</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> of which though every one is but one Tree, yet are there many <hi>Branches</hi> in every Tree, all of which ought to be laden with the <hi>fruits of righteouſneſs.</hi> The perſon is the ſame, though he paſs through the differing <hi>changes</hi> of Youth and Age, ſingle and married Eſtate; publick and private, proſperous and adverſe eſtate; in every of which <hi>changes,</hi> he ought to order his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30252:13"/>
way aright. There is an evil time, when the Righteous are to keep ſilence; and a good time, when more liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be uſed. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us there is one duty properly belongs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and another to adverſity. The deſcription of the Righteous that are planted by the Rivers of Gods Sanctuary, is that their Leaf ſhall not wither; they ſhall never change their hue, or recede from their profeſſion; and that they ſhall bring forth their fruit in the ſeaſon of it. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> applies himſelf in his Epiſtle to young Men and Children, as well as to old men; implying that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct fruit was to be expected, according to thoſe diſtinct ages of Chriſtians: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the operation of vertue. The way of any man that deſires to ſee the Salvation of God, may be beſt digeſted into this method, or order:

                  <p n="1">1. As to what is paſt, his way is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Repentance from all dead works formerly committed, which cannot be

carried on effectually to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in the Lord Jeſus, by whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and blood alone, pardon and remiſſion of ſin muſt be had, and reconciliation with God obtained. For that man will never walk aright in the way of Repentance that is not by Faith firſt reconciled unto God. As the Scripture tells us, without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; and whatever is not of Faith is ſin. <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>that it was as a Sword within his bones, while they ſaid unto him, where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> well pleaſed. Till then, as we can have no intereſt in God, ſo neither can he have any actual communication of life and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs with him without the daily exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt which is our life; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30252:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who as a living foundation and root, doth quicken all thoſe who are as lively ſtones built upon him, and as living Branches united unto him, as to the true Olive. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance therefore is another part of our way together with faith: Theſe two are inſeparable Companions in the condition of the Goſpel: Theſe two are alwayes joyned together in the Doctrine and way of Salvation. Sinners that would enjoy the Salvation of God, muſt as well undo the evil that is paſt by true Repentance, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do that which is right for the time that is to come. Forgiveneſs is as freely extended by God, as a God of all grace, as it was ever declared in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or covenant of Gods grace; yet tis added, only acknowledge thine iniquity. And though there be many inſtances of Gods pardoning grace extended to great ſinners, yet it is no particular inſtance, of any ſuch act of Grace from God, where there was no certain ſign of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>David</hi>'s heart went too intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately out toward <hi>Abſalom:</hi> that he ſeems reſolved to have pardoned him, though
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30252:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had never given any real evidence of ſincere Repentance. But the pardoning of Fratricide without repentance made him the readier to adventure upon Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide afterward. God ſeemed as forward and willing to pardon <hi>David</hi> as ever he did any of the Sons of Men, and accepts of, as little evidence for Repentance; yet that which was, was ſincere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficient, <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> Confeſſion, as that was circumſtanced, implied all the other parts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing we are apt to ſin daily, and are directed to pray daily for the pardon of our ſins, ſo Repentance is a work, it is never out of ſeaſon, while the Children of God carry a body of death along with them. He that is wicked already, may have daily need to waſh his feet, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.10 Although our perſons be already ſanctified by the Spirit; yet in regard of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of corruption, our affections are as apt to be defiled by our converſe with the men of the World, as are the feet of them that tread upon that Earth.

If we ſay we have no ſin, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>we lie, and the truth is not in us: but if we do ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, whoſe blood cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> and the way to make uſe thereof, is by the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as well as of Faith, elſe it may juſtly be returned upon us in any of our duties of Religious Worſhip, as God ſaith to the wicked, <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee.</hi> And therefore we ſhall find it alwayes preſcribed by God, and practiſed by his

To frame their doings ſo as to turn to their God, from whom afore time they have fallen by their iniquity: yet now they muſt come up to a reſolution to do ſo no more. The wrath of God which is revealed from Heaven, is againſt the ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of Men, and therefore the way to enjoy the Salvation of God, and avoid the wrath which is to come, requires us in the firſt place to live godly in the preſent World, of which there are two Branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A religious obſervance of all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods Worſhip. God expects to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30252:16"/>
be worſhipped after a due manner by all thoſe that deſire to ſee his Salvation. That God who is the Creator of the ends of the Earth, alwayes required homage from the Inhabitants thereof; and thoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are deſtined to his Curſe and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that live in the neglect thereof, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> Such therefore as reſtrain Prayer, and call not on the Name of the Lord, are ſo far from ſeeing his Salvation, that they may juſtly fear, they ſhall feel his Indignation. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>the Friend of God:</hi> for whoſe ſake he reproved Kings, giving them in ſpecial charge not to work him any harm, where ever he came to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ. The firſt thing you hear of him is his building an Altar, and calling on the Name of the Lord, as may be ſeen in the firſt part of his Pilgrimage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.4, 18. Nor was <hi>Abram</hi> the firſt who was noted for this Religious care of Gods Worſhip. For we read that <hi>Noah,</hi> as ſoon as ever he came out of the Ark, built an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30252:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Altar, and offered Sacrifices thereon, out of thoſe few clean Beaſts that were left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live after the great Deluge. Probably he might conceive, that it was in great part for the neglect thereof, that a Deluge of Water was brought upon the World. For ever ſince the dayes of <hi>Seth,</hi> when firſt there were found People enough to make publick Aſſemblies, <hi>they began to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> and ſo continued till the degenerate Off-ſpring of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generation, had through their great Impiety in a manner wholy laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
                  <p>In like manner was it obſerved as moſt commendable in <hi>David,</hi> that as ſoon as ever he was ſettled in his Kingdom, the firſt publick deſign he takes in hand, is the bringing home the Ark of God to the Tent which he had prepared for it at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> as well knowing that his eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Worſhip of God, would be the directeſt means to eſtabliſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his poſſeſſion, for the work of God had been ſadly neglected, or but ſlightly managed, ever ſince <hi>Saul</hi> was called to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30252:17"/>
the Kingdom. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that had ſo large a promiſe for ſettling of the Kingdom in his proſperity, yet lays the Foundation of his and their ruin in his Idolatry, and falſe Worſhip: which proved in like manner a fatal ſtumbling block in the way of all the ſucceeding Kings, though in many things elſe, never ſo hopeful and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in themſelves. It was the neglect of the Worſhip of God that loſt <hi>Jehu</hi> and his Family the Kingdom, and which at laſt coſt the ten Tribes their Countrey. For how zealous ſoever <hi>Jehu</hi> was in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> he was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs as the reſt in ſetting up the Worſhip of the Lord. For tis ſaid, <hi>He took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> it muſt in a ſpecial manner be underſtood, as to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of the <hi>golden Calves,</hi> for in other things, he was careful very exactly to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that will of the Lord, as in puniſhing the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him. Thus was it foretold by the Prophet <hi>Joel, That whoſoever called on the Name of the Lord ſhould be ſaved.</hi> What was it that ruined the Goſpel

                  <p>Then if you would your ſelves, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that yours ſhould ſee the ſalvation of God, look to maintain and carry on the Worſhip of God in your Aſſemblies, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and in your own hearts and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets. The Worſhip of God was ordered aright in <hi>David's</hi> and <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, and in the firſt part of <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> Reign; And ſo long things went well; but when <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heboam</hi> and his People, forſook the Law of the Lord, God forſook them, and left them in the hand of their Enemies: nor did any of the following Kings ever ſee the Salvation of God longer than they were careful to maintain and carry on the true Worſhip of God, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Hezechiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> For by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and falſe Worſhip of the other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30252:18"/>
Kings, their Kingdoms became low and broken, till at laſt they were broken to pieces, were carried Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were never reſtored to the honour of a Kingdom afterward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of our Religious care muſt be to maintain Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in heart and life; that the Holy God not only be Worſhipped, but that he be worſhipped in an holy manner: Reverend and Holy is his Name; and he will be ſanctified in all them that draw near unto him, elſe he will ſanctifie himſelf upon them; and they ſhall by that means be far from ſeeing the Salvation of God; as was the caſe of them that offered ſtrange fire upon <hi>Gods Altar.</hi> Thus the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> tells them, and convinces them out of the Law, that the impurity of their hearts and lives, rendred all they did, as to the external part of Gods Worſhip, unclean: For where the mind and conſcience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and unclean, all the ſervice that ſuch perform muſt needs be defiled thereby. It is the lifting up of clean hands that muſt obtain Gods Salvation: he threatens
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30252:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to hide his eyes from beholding thoſe hands that are defiled with blood, or any other wickedneſs: for which-out ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our worſhip and obedience, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs and impiety may be carried on under the outward form of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, as <hi>Paul</hi> foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter dayes, and we have ſeen it fulfilled in our times. This was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time when this Pſalm was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and many others; I will not reprove thee for thy burnt offerings, <hi>I will take no Bullock out of thy Stall. Offering and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> ſayes <hi>David</hi> in another Pſalm, <hi>thou delighteſt not in, elſe would I give it thee,</hi> i. e. comparatively; They were the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Righteouſneſs, that God moſt of all delighted in: the other without this, were not of themſelves deſirable at all. Outward Worſhip without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of inward piety, and holineſs, are part of the bodily exerciſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>which profits little. Saul</hi> himſelf ſeems not to have been wanting in Sacrifices; for he reſerved the fatteſt of them for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30252:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that end; but <hi>Samuel</hi> tells him, <hi>that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was better than Sacrifice, and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken than the fat of Rams.</hi>

converſation, is that which concerns our ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> Sobriety and Temperance, which according to the aſſertion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is part of that Doctrine which brings Salvation along with it, wherever it is put in practice. As we find it expreſſed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. And here lies the greateſt danger of a profeſſing People. Open unrighteouſneſs is reſtrained by the ſevere <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> of <hi>civil Nations,</hi> where Intemperance, and Prophaneneſs may appear with open face upon the ſtage. Injuſtice in <hi>civil affairs,</hi> as it is obvious to humane and common obſervation, ſo is it more apt to be reſtrained and puniſhed, as ſtanding in direct oppoſition to the commerce, and traffick of Nations: every one will be ready to bring a ſtone to fling at an Oppreſſor, Thief, or Robber; but now the Luſts of Intemperance are more ſecretly and ſilently carried on; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining thoſe Banks that ſeem to keep it in, and inſenſibly by degrees, like the <hi>Ivy,</hi> ſucking out the heart and life of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of thoſe whom it ſeems to compaſs about and embrace. Theſe Luſts of the <pb n="37" facs="tcp:30252:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fleſh ſecretly eat out the life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and damps the heat of our zeal. They are alſo the more apt to prevail upon the minds of the uncautelous; becauſe they are ſeated in ſuch things as for the matter of them are not unlawful, yea are both natural, and acceſſary; which made one ſadly complain, <hi>In licitis perimus omnes.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> could neither be enchanted by Sorcery, nor corrupted by Idolatry, yet they may be charmed by the <hi>Syren</hi> of ſenſual delights: for when the people had committed carnal Fornication with the <hi>Midianitiſh Women,</hi> they are eaſily led on to commit ſpiritual Adultery with their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. <hi>Solomon</hi> might ſpeak it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well as by obſervation of the ſtrange Women, <hi>that ſtrong men have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down wounded by her:</hi> When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil came to aſſault our Saviour, he found nothing in him to faſten his Temptations upon; there was no combuſtible matter for his <hi>fiery Darts</hi> to ſieze upon, but when he comes to <hi>David,</hi> though never ſo holy a man, he finds ſomething to fix upon, eſpecially when he lay at an open Guard,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30252:25"/>
having ungirt himſelf, and laid aſide the Armour of light. A chaſt converſation coupled with fear, is the beſt ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe <hi>Luſts</hi> of the Fleſh that war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Souls.</p>
                  <p>The ſeeds of Piety and vertue, are in as much danger of being choaked with theſe <hi>Weeds</hi> of Intemperance, as by the <hi>Thorns</hi> of Covetouſneſs and other Luſts of like nature.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are other Branches of a well ordered Converſation, very neceſſary to bring about this Salvation of God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Prophaneneſs and Impiety may get ſuch an head in places, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppreſs or bear them down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an eminent degree of zeal; God was ſo provoked with the ſenſual luſts of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> at <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> that if it had not been for the zeal of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> that Generation as commendable as they were, had ſeen but little of the ſalvation of God: it was his zeal that ſtayed the Plague from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the People. If our zeal be not as hot as fire, it will eaſily be quenched by theſe Fleſhly Luſts. <hi>Eli</hi> did not want a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30252:25"/>
principle of holineſs and the fear of God, but he wanted the holy paſſion of zeal to actuate and exert it. No man had ever more experience of ſeeing the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God than <hi>David;</hi> and what man did ever declare more zeal againſt ſin, and for the Glory of God, and caſting off the works of iniquity; doth he not engage that a vile perſon ſhall not tarry in his ſight, and him that telleth lies he would cut off: <hi>If ſuch be ſuffered</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>by the Ruler, all his Servants will be miſlead. Then farewel Gods Salvation.</hi> The Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> loſt her dignity for want of zeal; and is ſeverely threatned for this defect: <hi>Be zealous, and repent, or elſe I will ſpue thee out of my mouth,</hi> Rev. 4.16. a cold dull, un-active, luke-warm ſpirit will in a little time loſe the very life of godlineſs; when in the primitive Church the love of many began to wax cold; it was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of their Deſolation, which ſoon after came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt look to our zeal, that it be not mingled with too much wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire; for the wrath of man will never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30252:26"/>
work the righteouſneſs of God. The Lord Jeſus, was, as became the Lamb of God, <hi>meek and lowly of heart;</hi> yet was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably zealous againſt Hypocriſie, and ſecret iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Tis good to be zealouſly affected in a good matter, ſayes the Apoſtle. And ſo alſo in a good manner: The Diſciples were zealouſly affected againſt them that did not follow them; this was not in a good matter: nor was their zeal to be commended that forbad them bringing little Children to the Lord Jeſus. And if the Angel that contended with the Devil about the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing accuſations, there had been a defect in the manner. Zeal is an holy affection, and will thrive beſt in a meek and quiet ſpirit. No man ſo meek upon the face of the Earth as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet no man was found ſo zealous as <hi>Moſes,</hi> in reforming the Idolatry of the People, when he ſet every man againſt his fellow that was gulty of the fact; and at laſt grinding the Idol to powder that they might drink it down, that ſo eagerly had drunk down
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30252:26"/>
that curſed Worſhip. The zeal of <hi>Moſes</hi> was far more acceptable to God than that of <hi>Jonah,</hi> or <hi>Jehu.</hi> It is not the hot, fiery, curſt tempers in a place, that will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep up the purity of Religion, and good order, ſo well as that which proceeds from men of ſedate, compoſed, even tempers, who are alwayes the ſame for their love to piety and holineſs, and hatred of all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the next place, Conſtancy and Perſeverance may be added here: It is not enough to begin well, unleſs we hold on, unleſs we would fall under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles cenſure of the <hi>Gallathians, Ye did run well once, who hindred you?</hi> he that turns aſide out of the way, or ſits down diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, will no more obtain the deſired end, than he that never entred thereinto. Therefore Chriſt tells us, <hi>He that endures to the end, only ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Many a Mans obedience is by <hi>fits</hi> and <hi>girds,</hi> as they are urged and put on by the force of external motives, whereas thoſe that act from an inward Principle are ever the ſame. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:30252:27"/>
that ſuch as his Letters were when he was abſent, ſuch ſhall his deeds be when he is preſent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. So ſhould a Chriſtian be, the ſame at laſt, which he was at firſt. <hi>The Righteous</hi> ſaith Job. <hi>ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath ſtrong hands ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. Who ever entreth into the way of Gods Precepts with a ſincere mind, muſt engage with <hi>David,</hi> to continue in the ſame to the end: and ſuch who do not ſo do, will appear to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſelf-condemned. For if it were not in their judgment and conſcience the right way, why did they ever walk therein? and if it were really ſo, why did they turn aſide therefrom! And as to Gods Salvation, there will no ſort of men in the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be found further therefrom, than ſuch as are guilty of backſliding from the way of Obedience. The back-ſlider in heart is threatned to be filled with his own wayes. One ſaith well, <hi>There are none ſo bad as they that have been good, and are not, or may be good, and will not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this of conſtancy may be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30252:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
univerſality of Obedience; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation cannot be ordered aright, that lives in the omiſſion of any of the known duties of Religion or righteouſneſs: <hi>David</hi> accounted it matter of ſhame to be found not to have reſpect to any of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. How can two be ſaid to walk together that are not agreed upon all the points of love and obedience, wherein they are concerned. As God was not liable to be taxed for breach of Covenant in any the leaſt particular of his promiſes, ſo doth he threaten to make the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> know to their coſt their inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contrary; <hi>yea, ſhall know my breach of Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. In like manner he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects univerſality and conſtancy of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in his People.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The laſt thing here required is diſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etion and wiſdome. It was not enough for <hi>David</hi> to chuſe the perfect way of Gods Preceps to walk in, but to walk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2. There are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors on the right hand as well as on the left; he that would approve himſelf as upright, muſt turn aſide to neither: for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30252:28"/>
the preventing of which no ſmall Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be required. This our Saviour would have his <hi>Diſciples</hi> aware of, when he adviſes them <hi>being ſent as ſheep among Wolves, to be wiſe as Serpents, innocent as Doves.</hi> There is much of Truth in the old ſaying, <hi>Quis que faber fortunoe ſuoe:</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in a great meaſure is the Author of his own weal or woe. We may by this means do much of our ſelves, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our ſeeing the Salvation of God. <hi>David</hi> was wiſe as an Angel of God, and by that Wiſdom declared much of that evil which otherwiſe might have overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him in <hi>Sauls</hi> Court: ſo as it is ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five times in one Chapter, <hi>David be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf wiſely among Sauls Servants, and proſpered whitherſoever he went:</hi> And indeed the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do expreſs Proſperity and Wiſdom by one and the ſame word, becauſe Wiſdom hath a great influence into the ſucceſs of our affairs. Many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be given hereof:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had been called out of his own Countrey, was caſt among
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30252:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeveral People or Families of another, or rather of a falſe Religion; that lived without the fear of God: he accounted it his Wiſdom, not to intermeddle in their quarrels, nor yet to enter into too much Familiarity, ſo neither not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline mutual Duties of Humanities, wherein they might be mutually helpful one to another; yet on the other hand was careful not to quarrel with thoſe of his own perſwaſion, <hi>for fear of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Heathen amongſt whom they ſojourned:</hi> he will rather looſe of his juſt right, in matter of his Poſſeſſions, than looſe his reputation in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>He wiſely foreſaw the <hi>Perizzite</hi> would make an ill uſe of his quarrelling with his Brother <hi>Lot,</hi> about ſo inconſiderable a matter as their Sheep-walks.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of contending with our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is not beſt alwayes to ſtand too much upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our own Right.</p>

So for our Inferiours and Equals; Wiſdom as we are told in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> muſt diſcover to us when we ſhould make anſwer to a Fool, and when we ſhould leave him to anſwer himſelf in his own Folly. Nor is it alwayes beſt to force a matter on with main ſtrength, when Wiſdom may direct how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt difficulties, by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while: <hi>David</hi> ſucceeded better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> by fetching a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, then by falling directly upon them. <hi>Joſiah</hi> one of the beſt of all the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet by an error in this kind, did not ſee the ſalvation of God in that laſt Trajedy of his life, whereby he brought a fatal ſtroak of death upon his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which his Holineſs and Piety had a great while before kept off from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and himſelf, and ſo might ſtill have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30252:29"/>
done, if he had not ſo much failed in point of this Wiſdom, about medling with a controverſie which did little or nothing concern him at that time. For he that medleth with a ſtrife, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, as <hi>Solomon tells us,</hi> doth but hold a Dog by the ears, whom he can neither detain, nor let go without great danger to himſelf. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had better ſucceſs in his conteſt with the great King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> for as tis ſaid, <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge were the ſtability of his times,</hi> and therefore it is added, <hi>that the ſtrength of Salvation was his,</hi> Iſai. 33.6. If we caſt an eye upon all the following Hiſtories of the Church, in ſucceeding Ages, we ſhall find, that much of thoſe ſufferings which have fallen upon the Generation of the juſt, might either have been prevented or much abated; if they had governed their affairs by a ſuitable meaſure of Wiſdom in their concerns with themſelves or others. For the confirmation of this Truth, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Deliverances in thoſe times were but as Types and Shadows figuring out the ſpiritual Salvation of the Church of the <pb n="48" facs="tcp:30252:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpel; when being delivered from the <hi>hands</hi> of all <hi>ſpiritual Enemies,</hi> they might ſerve God with Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all their dayes: even in thoſe times when the Church of the Faithful was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with the Day-ſpring from on high, and made to ſee this Salvation of God in the full accompliſhment of it as to this <hi>life. Many are the afflictions of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>of old, but God deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you out of all,</hi> Pſal. 34.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> himſelf was a long time exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>trials,</hi> but by Faith and Patience, he lived to ſee the Salvation which God had promiſed to come out of Sion. This was but a type of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salvation of the World through Chriſt <hi>by the preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> which was to begin at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> are as full of <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> as they are <hi>of Precepts</hi> and <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> to keep the way of the Lord and to do juſtice and judgment. The 26th Chapt. <hi>of Levit.</hi> and the 28th <hi>of Deut.</hi> are wholly taken up that way. <hi>Dwell in the Land and do good, ſo verily thou ſhalt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30252:30"/>
be fed, and ſee good. Behold the upright and perfect man,</hi> Pſal. 37.37. <hi>the end of that man ſhall be peace:</hi> whatever are the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes God leads them through by his unſearcheable diſpenſations; ſo tis ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If ye be obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land:</hi> ſo long as they were obedient they did ſo, both in the former and following times. All the dayes of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and the Elders that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-lived <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> they ſaw the Salvation of God in all their enterprizes; becauſe all their time they ordered their way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and to do judgment and juſtice; but when they of the next Generation fell from God, and turned into other wayes, what miſerable calamities befell them in the time of the Judges, and their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings; there was no peace to them that went out, and to them that came in, for God vexed them with all adverſity, and they could never come to ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God.</p>
                  <p>Gods providences ordinarily have been like Weather-glaſſes; the waters thereof
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30252:31"/>
as to their peace and proſperity might have been diſcerned to riſe and fall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his people did ebb or flow in the courſe of their obedience: They ſay the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſe to preſage of the health, or fertility of every year, by the riſing of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> higher or lower: ſo might any one who lived in the time of any of their Judges, or Kings, have foretold the proſperity, or miſery of the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of their obedience. When they did evil, it went ill with them; and when they did well in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, though not in that perfect manner as they ſhould; yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily they were made to ſee the ſalvation of God: As in the firſt years of <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Abijah, Joaſh, Amazias</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzias.</hi> Thus did God ordinarily proportion the wayes of his providence to his peoples obedience.</p>
                  <p>When of old the whole World dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the true Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, none was found Righteous but <hi>Noah,</hi> and a few in his Family; God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30252:31"/>
makes him and them only ſee the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</p>
                  <p>So afterwards, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. tis ſaid <hi>David</hi> proſpered whither ſoever he went, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt five ſeveral Nations at once, becauſe his heart was right, and he ordered his way aright before God, he was made a laſting monument of Gods deliverance, as he had been a ſtanding pattern of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus we may ſay with the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> time would fail to ſpeak of other Inſtances, upon whom this promiſe was made good, both before and after the captivity; who ever walked with God, and ordered their way aright before him, they were made to ſee the ſalvation of God in the midſt of Armies, Lions Dens, Fiery Furnaces; and amongſt multitudes of Enemies, who were all armed with envy and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as well as with force and power.</p>
                  <p>Afterward as <hi>Ezrah</hi> ordered his way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in bringing up as many as he could perſwade to attend thereunto out of the Captivity, and in ſeeking the face of God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30252:32"/>
by ſolemn Faſting and Prayer, ſo God cauſed him to ſee his Salvation more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately then if he had obtained a band of Horſe-men from an Heathen; And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> at another time, obtains favour in the ſight of the man, as he deſired, who had then all power under God in his hands, concerning the poor captive <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe he ordered his way aright, firſt to ſeek God by ſolemn Prayer, and then to go on couragiouſly without fearing the face of Man, eſpecially ſuch Sons of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſs, as were <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> who though they pretended a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to help build the Temple of God at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet in their hearts were filled with rancour and enmity, and ready to gnaſh their teeth, that any came thither, that ſought the welfare of the people of God.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church ſince Chriſts time, for this firſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, how mightily did the Word of God increaſe and prevail. The ſavour of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt even tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in every place: the three mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30252:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of meal, <hi>i. e.</hi> the three parts of the World then known were levened with the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion; the whole World was in a manner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread therewith, notwithſtanding all the fury, rage and malice of their perſecuting Enemies; he that ſate upon the white Horſe, with his Bow and his Crown, went on conquering to conquer, and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. All this while they ordered their way aright; they ſet themſelves by faith and patience to wait upon God, and were made to ſee his Salvation. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> came firſt out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if God had led them preſently into the poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> before they had been inured to the difficulties of a War: God muſt miraculouſly have cut off all their Enemies to have put them in poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then they would have been in danger to have been overcome with luxury, ſenſuality and ſecurity, as too ſoon came to paſs afterwards; therefore God in his infinite wiſdom did train them up to encounter with Marches and Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyings in the Wilderneſs, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30252:33"/>
them with the difficulties of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long War, that they might learn Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by what they underwent: ſo in a manner were Gods diſpenſations toward the Chriſtian World; God would not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly ſubdue them to the obedience of Faith; but by the labour and travel of the Miniſtry in holding forth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, the word of Chriſts patience, leaſt if it had been otherwiſe, they ſhould have grown ſecure and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and turned the Grace of God into laſciviouſneſs; as many were too apt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but preſently after the winter of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and Perſecution was over and paſt, and the ſummer of proſperity came upon them, how ſoon were they, even the face of the whole Chriſtian World over-run with a deluge of Impiety and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? how ſoon was the pure and choice Wine of the Goſpel mingled with the <hi>Mara</hi> waters of the Curſe, and their ſilver all become Droſs?

But they that order their way aright, in the ſenſe of the Text, ſhall ſooner or later ſee the ſalvation of God.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:30252:34"/>The Reaſons of this Point are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally theſe three:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the conſideration of God, whoſe Name is engaged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſalvation of his People. The perfections of the Almighty oblidge him to ſhew his ſalvation to all them that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their way aright, and only to them that ſo do. His eyes run to and fro through the whole Earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect before him: then 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. his omnipotent arm is ſtretched out to ſave and deliver all ſuch: <hi>walk before me and be upright, I am God al-ſufficient,</hi> ſaith <hi>God to Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.1. And as his hand is able to ſave them, ſo is his ear, as well as his eye open to their cry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. yea, ſometimes before they call God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anſwer, and whiles they are yet ſpeaking he will hear, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.24. to the like purpoſe is their promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.9, 10. His word and faithfulneſs is engaged alſo, to ſave all the meek of the Earth: they whoſe hearts are lifted up in them, are not right before him, but humble, contrite
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30252:34"/>
ones,, are the people he is engaged to ſave and defend: yea he hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his promiſe, in the 15 verſe of this fiftieth Pſalm, <hi>that if they call upon him in the day of trouble, he will anſwer them.</hi> The face of the Lord is ſet againſt all you that do evil. He is an holy God, and therefore hath declared, that the evil ſhall not dwell with him: he hates the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity, and all them that turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to their own crooked wayes: and his Juſtice is armed againſt them with ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to puniſh them. Not one <hi>iota</hi> of his threatnings ſhall ſhall paſs away till all be fulfilled ſooner or later upon all the wicked of the World, whoſe wayes are perverſe before him. Yea, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared concerning all ſuch, that when they ſpread forth their hands he will hide his eyes, and when they make many prayers he will not hear, becauſe their hearts and hands are defiled with the guilt of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the conſideration of his People, who when they order their way aright, are in a meet capacity for mercy, and fit for ſalvation. In caſe of a peoples
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30252:35"/>
continued obedience, they may plead Gods Covenant, that they are his People, he is obliged to be their God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be their Saviour, and to do all that a God can do for them; and in caſe they have ſinned, and done never ſo perverſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yet if they order their way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as to Repentance and Reformation, his Covenant doth then alſo oblige him to cauſe them to ſee his Salvation: this is expreſly mentioned by <hi>Solomon</hi> at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Temple, when there was a ſolemn reſtipulation, or renewing of Covenant between God and his People, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. when God appeared unto <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> as is expreſſed in the 14th verſe of the next Chapter; he ſeems to aſſent to all thoſe Articles; <hi>If my People, who are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear from Heaven and forgive their ſin, and will heal their Land,</hi> in reſpect of all thoſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inſiſted on at large in the former cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and briefly ſummed up in the former verſe. They ſhall be made to fee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30252:35"/>
of God delivering them from all thoſe evils, or what ever elſe might be conceived to befal them. It may be ſaid of ſuch an holy, or ſuch an humbled Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they are a people prepared for the Lord; ready for the ſalvation of the Lord, and it ſhall not be long before they ſee it. Salvation ſhall be for Gates and Bulwarks to ſuch a People: ſo was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the people in his time; who had ſought the Lord, and did by Faith rely upon him; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is now walled about with Salvation: the proud <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall not be able to ſhoot an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row over ſuch Bulwarks, much leſs ſhall he be able to break through thoſe Gates of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This is an experience confirmed of old to the Faith of a believing People, ever ſince <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time: no doubt he had been humbled for his deceiving his Father, and was reconciled to God, before he took his journey into <hi>Padan-aram,</hi> and therefore now he can plead the Covenant of God, and put the Almighty in mind of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; <hi>Thou ſaidſt thou wilt bleſs me;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30252:36"/>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall be made to ſee Gods Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the midſt of thoſe dangers h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>God did afterwards make the way of his Precepts plain before his Servants in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomie;</hi> inſtructing them how they ſhould walk before him in the enjoying, and improving that good Land they were going to poſſeſs; how they ſhould till and dreſs it, how they ſhould reap it, and diſpoſe of the fruits thereof; if they could then ſay, when they came with their Oblations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.13, 14, 15. <hi>I have brought away the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things out of my houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have not tranſgreſſed thy Commandments, neither have I forgotten them,</hi> &amp;c. Then might they alſo add what is in the 15th verſe, <hi>Look down from thy holy Habitation, from Heaven, and bleſs thy people Iſrael, and the Land which thou haſt given us, as thou ſwearest to our Fathers:</hi> Thus having, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their way aright, they might with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30252:36"/>
confidence and comfort, expect to ſee the Salvation of God. When a People ſo walk, as that they can approve themſelves to God himſelf, as <hi>Abraham, I know</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>that he will not only himſelf keep the way of the Lord, but command his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold after him to keep the ſame;</hi> It may then be expected that God will bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the good which he hath ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From the conſideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the World. If ſuch a People that order their wayes aright in their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking with God, or that ſo frame their doings as to turn unto the Lord their God, if at any time they ſhould humble themſelves before him, and yet ſhould not ſee the ſalvation of God, what would the wicked and ungodly of the World ſay, but that it is in vain to ſerve God? And what advantage is there in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and keeping the whole Law of God? if they are like to be plagued as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; it will be in vain to alter their courſe and live otherwayes than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:30252:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>This were certainly to ſin againſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the juſt, in the midſt of whom God is alwayes wont to be found. God will therefore have it known in the world that there is great recompence of reward in keeping the Law of the Lord, and that though the righteous ſcarcely are ſaved, yet ſaved they ſhall be, whatever become of others. Let <hi>Balak</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together to enchant the Tents of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and lay ſtumbling blocks before their Feet, yet ſome ſhall be found in the midſt of them, ſo to order their wayes, as that they ſhall be able to ſave the reſt. They may elſe plead with God as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> once did in ſuch an exigent, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not ſee the ſalvation of God in a Military expedition, <hi>And what wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> Joſh 7.9. But <hi>Joſhuah</hi> is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not to be diſcouraged; let God alone to look after the glory of his own, if his People do but look after themſelves, and order their way aright, God will make all the reſt of the Nations to behold the glory of his Salvation: God is able to exalt the valleys and make the rough

places plain; The glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all Fleſh ſhall ſee it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But notwithſtanding all theſe great and glorious things that are ſpoken of the City of God; there lies this great ſtumbling block in the way of natural men, that they never can get over; yea, which the Saints themſelves are oft times at a great ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can ſee through it: they obſerve that though thoſe who are called the people of God, order their wayes never ſo right; yet they ſee the ſalvation of God no more than other men. They hear them complain with</hi> Aſaph, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Though they cleanſed their hearts, and waſhed their hands, yet all is in vain, they are yet plagued like other men all the day long, and chastened every morning. And with the Church in</hi> Pſal. 44.

It may certainly be ſaid unto every humbled, penitent, believing perſon, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, they ſhall ſee the Kingdom of God, and obtain his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and if they do not live to ſee a temporal ſalvation in this world, they ſhall be ſure not to miſs of eternal ſalvation at the laſt. Now let every one chuſe what he would have, to be ſaved from the wrath that is to come, that ſhall deſtroy the world of the ungodly at laſt, or to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from trouble and danger here, and periſh eternally at laſt. But the full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all objections of this nature, is, that according to Gods ordinary providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſpenſations, God is with his People, while they are with him; which is a truth confirmed by the experience of all ages,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30252:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and all People: for ſome have obſerved that the long continued ſucceſs, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their heathen Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a reward of their juſtice, temperance, and induſtry. So was it in the dayes of <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and other good Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> But if God ſhould ſee cauſe for a time, out of his infinite wiſdom and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to change the hands of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and lay the left hand of favour and proſperity upon the younger &amp; leſs deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is a ſoveraign Ruler and may do what he will with his own; he may afflict his people in this life, and proſper the wicked for a time, for ends beſt known to himſelf; yet all this while, he is near unto his people in all they call upon him for, to uphold and preſerve them in, and carry them through all their ſufferings, and make them ſee his eternal ſalvation at laſt. None of theſe things, <hi>ſc.</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tribulations, and croſſes moved the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo he might finiſh his courſe with joy.

ſouls, as a <hi>Monk</hi> ſaid, ſtroking his paunch, <hi>Modo hic ſit bene.</hi> Or what were a man the better if he could gain the whole world, and miſs of the ſalvation of his ſoul at laſt. If the body be loſt, deſtroyed by the elements, returned to its firſt principles, or reduced into the minuteſt Atomes, yet all ſhall be gathered together again, and raiſed up in a ſtate of greater Glory and beauty, than ever it was laid down in; 'Twas obſerved that the ſpirit of Glory reſted upon the primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Confeſſors, ſo as there enemies were not able to behold the refulgence of them. 'Twas ſaid of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that they were not able to reſiſt the wiſdom, and ſpirit, by which he ſpake; and that as he ſaw heaven opened, the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God, ſo they ſaw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. This might be ſaid to be extraordinary. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of all Believers, declares how they are able to triumph over ſin and death, and boldly challenge the victory from them all; <hi>Oh death, where is thy ſting, Oh grave
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30252:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where is thy victory?</hi> yea, he proceeds further, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Nay, in all theſe we are more than Conquerors.</hi> A great ſpeech, for one that had been ſo ſadly handled by Men and Devils. Yet ſuch is the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of faith, whereby Believers are enabled not only to get the victory, but even to triumph over all their enemies: therefore doth it neceſſarily follow, that through faith, which is the ſubſtance of things hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, they may be able to ſee the ſight of Gods ſalvation, even then when they paſs through the dark vally of the ſhadow of death. The Lord Jeſus was never ſeen more glorious on earth, than in that apparrel which was dyed red, and ſtained with the blood of his enemies, when he ſpeaks in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave. In like manner the followers of Jeſus are alſo glorious in their apparrel, when they are thus clothed with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Salvation, and aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that which ere long they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enjoy.</p>

the times of their greateſt proſperity, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo far ſecured from trouble, but that they may need ſalvation.</hi> All Believers are, or may be aſſured of ſpiritual ſalvation; they may certainly conclude, they ſhall at the laſt receive the end of their faith the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls: but they may often ſtand in need of temporal ſalvation, <hi>David</hi> had as great proſperity in his reign, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any King on earth before him, for tis ſaid the Lord preſerved him whitherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he went: whence he was too ready to take up this concluſion, <hi>that he ſhould never be moved:</hi> That now all his forraign enemies, as well as inteſtine foes being ſubdued, <hi>his mountain stood ſo strong that it could never be ſhaken;</hi> But he ſoon found no ſmall trouble to ariſe by the hiding of Gods face, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7, 8. <hi>For though affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, as</hi> Job <hi>ſpeaks, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground, yet man is born unto trouble as the ſparks fly upward:</hi> i. e. Troubles come not by chance, nor are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the miſcarriage of ſecondary cauſes; <hi>yet man is born unto trouble as the

ſparks fly upward: he works himſelf trouble as eaſily, and ordinarily as if he were born for that end.</hi> It is as natural for man to breed himſelf trouble, as for ſparks to fly upward. Weeds grow out of the ground without mens labour or care; but mens ſins are the meritorious cauſe deſerving, and procuring, and Gods wiſdom and ſoveraignty are the efficient and inflictive cauſe of them, we bring our ſelves into troubles, but it is God only that can ſave us out of them. God hath the hearts of all men in his hand, and turns them as the Rivers of water: He can turn them to favour, or hate his People as he ſees cauſe. The time was when all that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did pleaſed the people, but afterwards the people are diſpleaſed with him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and follow <hi>Abſolom.</hi> God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby to chaſten <hi>David,</hi> and to puniſh the iniquity of the People, that had no better improved the bleſſing, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of God in the time of <hi>Davids</hi> reign. In <hi>Hezekiah</hi> time <hi>Sennacherib</hi> comes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and takes them, and layes ſiege to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:30252:42"/>
it ſelf. The Prophet therefore calleth the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> the Rod of God's anger, and the ſtaff of his indignation in their hand; but when God hath accompliſhed his work upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the humbling of his People, and pulling down their pride, he will then puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the glory of his high looks: He will then call them to account for their proud words, and blaſphemous ſpeeches. God leads his People through various changes and difficult paths, ſometimes they are made to paſs through the water, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the fire; they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deſtroyed by either, without ſome ſpecial kind of Salvation ſtretched forth. In the dayes of <hi>Amos,</hi> God called ſomtimes to contend by fire, that devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great deep, and eat up a part, as he ſpeaks, and ſomtimes by famine, all which bring <hi>Jacob</hi> low, that he is ſcarce able to ariſe. At another ſeaſon God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the multitude of this nation to gather themſelves together againſt his People, for the tryal of their faith and exerciſe of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30252:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their graces then the puniſhing of their ſins, as in <hi>Aſa's</hi> and <hi>Jehoſophat</hi>'s time, or rather that there might be a fit occaſion to cut off the wicked nations of the world; but yet they threaten ſorely the Church and People of God, that they might learn to put their confidence in him, <hi>who is the rock of their Salvation.</hi> There was one ſeaſon in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was without adverſity, or evil occurrent: <hi>Solomon</hi> was at that time called of God to attend the building of the Temple, and while he was intent upon that work, God was pleaſed to ſecure him from all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles; but after that time, God ſtirred him up many adverſaries round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that he was never able to ſuppreſs; &amp; though he might forget that calamity coming upon his family, he was neverable by all his wiſdom, to ſave himſelf and them from, or in the leaſt prevent. So as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God may have made a Covenant with his People ordered in all things and ſure, as to their eternal ſalvation, yet there may be cauſe for God to viſit them with temporal calamities and evils which they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30252:43"/>
know not how to ſave themſelves from. So deceitful are the hearts of the beſt of men, and ſo dangerous are the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, that God knows not how to truſt his People long with much outward proſperity and favour, leſt they ſhould be enſnared, and wax wanton and ſecure thereby. After the return from the captivity, when it might have been thought, that they had received double for their ſin, and that therefore now their warefare ſhould be accompliſhed, and that now from that time foreward, nothing but the oyl of comfort ſhould be poured into their wounds; yet you will find their ſuffrings were not quite ended: many clouds of threatning evil did continually ariſe, which much darkned their hopes of a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led time of tranquility. A meſſenger that came from <hi>Judah</hi> informs <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that the remnant of the captivity who were left then in the province were in great affliction and reproach, which made him ſit down and weep, and mourn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes: that in all that long tract of time, from <hi>Cyrus</hi> his dayes, to that time
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30252:44"/>
there was ſtill remaining nothing but the former ruthful ſpectacle of the old ſeige. The wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not yet repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor the gates ſet up; and which was yet worſe, there appeared no hope of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their condition, for the People of that Land, as is ſaid in <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.23. <hi>Still weakened their bands, and hired Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours against them, and hindred them, all the remainder of</hi> Cyrus <hi>his time, and all the following Kings, till the reign of</hi> Darius, <hi>when they obtained a decree to force them to deſiſt from the work.</hi> And in the time of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they invented and fomented falſe reports againſt them, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to rebel, which was the reaſon rendred, why they were ſo intenſe about rebuilding the wall; and when that would not do, ſome were hired by their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies, <hi>Sanballat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tobiah</hi> to diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them by lying propheſies when God ſent them not; only they were ſet on by others to put him in fear, that the work might not be carried on. Had <hi>Nehemiah</hi> been a man but of an ordinary courage, he might have been affrighted, and fled
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30252:44"/>
away to hide himſelf; but he was a man of ſo much magnanimity, as not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightned with great words or letters, though reiterated ſo many times over; but <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s confidence is in God, to whom he looks, to ſave his People from thoſe malicious attempts of their enemies. <hi>Haman</hi> afterwards prevailed ſo far by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and falſe accuſations, as to bring their neck unto the block. The day was appointed, the decree was ſealed, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> was diſtreſſed, and the whole City was perplexed; it was God only who was able to ſave them: by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hamans</hi> (as formerly he did <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi>) counſels to fooliſhneſs, and turning the ſnare, thoſe great Polititians had laid for others, into an halter wherewith to hang themſelves. There is no new thing under the ſun, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> that which hath already been done, and at preſent is, the like will be put in practice, while there is a devil in hell to tempt, and wicked men in the world to diſquiet, and diſturb the building of God's Church upon earth.

The Lord Jeſus, who is the only Saviour of his People, is brought in by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as one aſtoniſhed, that there was none to be found on earth, that would ſave his Church. I looked and there was none to help: I wondred that there was none to uphold, therefore his own arme brought him ſalvation. If we look round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world, amongſt the Princes, and Potentates of the Earth, how few friends hath <hi>Sion</hi> among them all; yea, few of her Sons are forward to take her by the hand.

that fell among thieves, who ſtripped him who wounded him and left him half dead. The Prieſt and the Levite who are moſt engaged by their relation, and profeſſion to help, in ſtead of that, paſs by on the other ſide, that they might not ſee or take notice: If God ſhould not put it into the heart of ſome good <hi>Samaritans,</hi> what would become of the poor Church of God?

If the caſe be ſo, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and ſalvation comes neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, but from God only; let all his People ſay with <hi>Jacob, we have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi> Let that be the anſwer to be returned to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the nations, that come to enquire or ſolicit about leagues or engagments, that God hath founded Sion, and the poor of his People ſhall truſt in her.

only hath the hearts of Kings in his hand to turn them as he pleaſes, but he hath alſo the Devil under his authority, if not to turn him, yet to chain him up, that he ſhall not hinder the Salvation of his Church. Such troubles may befall them that no other hand can ſave them from; but their comfort is, that although the powers of darkneſs may conſpire, and the gates of hell combine, yet they ſhall not prevail againſt them.

                  <p>The experiences of all former ages give in full evidence to this, that it is God only who is the Salvation of his People. <hi>Solomon</hi> had received a double portion of his fathers ſpirit, &amp; proſperity: yet <hi>David</hi> tells them in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. <hi>

Of all the Reformations that ever yet began in the World, there have been but a very few obſerved to continue above an hundred years in that ſplendor and brightneſs with which they were at the firſt ſet forward. Take for inſtance, thoſe of antient time, before or ſince the Goſpel began.

Godly and Learned Divines in them, to take pattern and example from, in the laying our firſt Foundation, both of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Righteouſneſs, Doctrine and Diſcipline, Church and Common-wealth. Our firſt Rulers and Leaders in both were careful to order all things according to the pattern in that Mount; Children that would not lye, ſo God became their Saviour; ſaving them from forreign and inteſtine Foes: If we that are their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be found Children that will lie, deny our firſt principles, either in Faith or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how can we expect that God ſhould be our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Now compare things:</p>

Such is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and filthy nature of ſin, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot keep at too great a diſtance therefrom, ſo as to hate the very garment ſpotted with the Fleſh. Our Rulers like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not take that liberty which is uſual with men of that capacity in other places, becauſe of the fear of God: The Prieſts or Miniſters of the Sanctuary were alſo cloathed with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There was no compliance with the World, in the vain cuſtoms, and fooliſh faſhions thereof, leaſt they might ſeem to fall ſhort of the promiſed reſt.

Sobriety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Moderation were the guize of thoſe times: Civil imployments were ſo ordered and managed, as not to hinder the higher deſigns of Faith and Holineſs, and promoting the glory of God.

believe in him whom he hath ſent into the World, to give Salvation to all that obey him. Before the Fall it was to do of our ſelves, by our own ſtrength; ſince the Fall it is to begin with Faith, which worketh by love, and which is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole Law.

Naturalliſts tell us, there are two great veins that ariſe out of the heart, the one called <hi>Vena porta,</hi> the other <hi>Vena cava,</hi> which carry forth out of the heart the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that quicken all the whole body: ſo ſpiritually, the heart purified by Faith, by thoſe two great iſſues of Religion and Righteouſneſs maintains the whole frame of obedience in the new-creature, <hi>teaching us to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world;</hi> They that ſo do are infallibly in the way of Salvation.</p>

                  <p>THe Words of the Text are added as a reaſon of the Words foregoing, <hi>Ceaſe ye from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, For behold the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts doth take away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The time which they ſeem to refer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to was under the Reign of <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when the ſtate of that Kingdom

was low and broken by forreign Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as inteſtine troubles: for we read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.6, 8. that in his dayes, <hi>Pekah</hi> the Son of <hi>Remaliah</hi> ſlew an 120000. in one day, all valiant men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides near double that number which were carried Captive, both Sons and Daughters; neither do any other times appear ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumitous ſince the Death of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> to which theſe words could ſo fitly be applied, when God was taking away from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> the whole ſtaffe of bread, and the whole ſtay of water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he would give children to be their Princes, and Babes ſhould rule over them, <hi>i. e.</hi> when he would withdraw all means, one and another, whereby as with a ſtaff, mans life is ſuſteined, and a ſtate ſupported; by the removing of the firſt, each mans life was in danger; by the latter, being the prime perſons, for Martial, Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical affairs, and not only the chief Ornaments, but the very Pillars and Props of the body politick, both of Church and State, when theſe are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <pb n="113" facs="tcp:30252:70"/>
the ruin of both muſt needs enſue, as of an houſe when the principal Studs are pull'd away that bear it up, ſo it befel the Temple of the Philiſtines, when <hi>Samſon</hi> pull'd down the Pillars that did ſupport it, as the Annotators ſpeak upon the place.

                     <hi>The man of War</hi>] Men that are skilful <pb n="114" facs="tcp:30252:71"/>
and expert in feats of Arms, and making War, that know how to go out, and to come in before a People; for this requires as well wiſdom of the mind, as courage and reſolution of the heart, and ſtrength of the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Judg, and the Prophet</hi>] Publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Common-wealth, and of the Church, the one to reform and puniſh vice by the execution of Juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniſhment upon Offenders; the other to preſs on to the ſtudy and practice of vertue; by inſtruction of mens minds in the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prudent and the Antient</hi>] In the Hebrew, it is the Diviner; but not to be taken in an evil ſence, to foretel future events, by a Diabolical art of Divination; but on the better; for men of much ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and depth of Judgment, ſtrength of Reaſon to bolt out the truth in things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and abſtruſe; to foreſee effects in their cauſes, to deem of future conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences by preſent appearances; readily <pb n="115" facs="tcp:30252:71"/>
to make conjecture of following events, by the preſent eſtate of affairs, as if he had a ſpirit of Divination, and by a kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtinct could foretel a Storm of evil while it is impending in the Clouds over head. The wiſe mans heart diſcerns of time and judgment; that which is ſaid of the men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> who had underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the times to know what ought to be done, for the avoiding of the evil fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or to bring about the good deſired; ſuch were the wiſe men that ſtood before <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> who could tell <hi>Rehoboam</hi> what would become of his Kingdom, if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſudden and raſh advice of his young upſtart Counſellers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Antient</hi>] Such as by their years and age have had experience of all kind of affairs; and therefore are the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to guid the helm of publick concerns, eſpecially in a ſtormy ſeaſon. It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſailing on thoſe ſeas in winter or ſtormy times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Captain of fifty</hi>] Such breaches were made in their Military matters, that <pb n="116" facs="tcp:30252:72"/>
there was ſcarce left a man able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand fifty followers; no ſuch were left as were able to undertake the conduct of Martial deſigns; ſome of whom were called to leſſer, and ſome greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as well as them that were to lead the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Honourable</hi>] In the Hebrew it is Eminent in countenance; not by Deſcent or Pedigree, or Nobility of Stock, which properly are not our own, as the Poet ſpeaks, <hi>Nam genus &amp; proavos, &amp;c.</hi> one that by reaſon of his wiſdome and gravity, carries Authority with him in his very countenance, though he pretend to no honour by his extraction; as our Saviour intimates, <hi>That a true Prophet deſerves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at home as well as abroad, though he ſhould be the Son of a Carpenter, and not of a Prophet.</hi> Authority that is acquired by deſert, or real worth, is much better than that which is obtained by dignity of place or birth: Lewd perſons may reproach the ſtock they iſſue from and gain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies no honour thereby, as one anſwered, <hi>Tu dedecus generi tuo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:30252:72"/>
                     <hi>The Counſellour</hi>] Such as are able to adviſe in the moſt weighty matters of Church or ſtate. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of Men would not act without counſel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he adviſed others to take that courſe, as a way of more ſafety; for we know he had thoſe that ſtood before him for that end: And we read that <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> took counſel with his Princes in his Warrs with the <hi>Aſſyrian:</hi> and it is to be feared that good <hi>Joſiah</hi> loſt his life by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without, or againſt the counſel of his few counſellers, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did his Kingdom. When things of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are managed without counſel all is like to fall to the ground, or miſcarry at home or abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cunning Artificer, and eloquent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi>] The one is neceſſary for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the other for Stabiliment and Safety. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> might have made a courtly Tabernacle and Temple, without the help of ſuch cunning Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as were <hi>Bezaleel, Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> but not ſo magnificent. God had <pb n="118" facs="tcp:30252:73"/>
ſometimes promiſed to make his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> the head, and not the tail; which muſt be underſtood of <hi>curious Artifices,</hi> as well as of <hi>coſtly Contrivances, and other Badges of Dignity.</hi> In the Catalogue of the Captives of <hi>Judah,</hi> are reckoned up, the <hi>Smiths</hi> and other <hi>Artizans,</hi> as well as the <hi>rich Citizens;</hi> for as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſerved by the Field, ſo is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a State maintained by the skill of their <hi>Artificers,</hi> in their ſeveral occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations: Therefore the removal of theſe is to be looked upon as a ſpecial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the loſs of any other ſort of men.</p>
                  <p>As for the eloquent Orator; it is in the <hi>Hebrew, He that is skilled in Charms, i. e.</hi> one that hath that power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in his ſpeech, either by the ſtrength, of his Arguments or Eloquence of his utterance or Elegancy of his Language, ſubtilty of his Expreſſions, that he is able to overcome and carry them Captive that he ſpeaks unto; as tis ſaid of <hi>David, that he bowed the hearts of all the Men of Judah <pb n="119" facs="tcp:30252:73"/>
as one man;</hi> the iron ſinews of mens wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſtinacy, and rebellious humors, are as it were melted by an inſinuation of ſweet words. <hi>The ſoft tongue breaketh the bone;</hi> ſuch <hi>Eloquent Orators</hi> by the ſilver Cords of their <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> do as it were chain the <hi>Hearers</hi> to their <hi>Lips:</hi> and his affable <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> have the ſame efficacy upon the <hi>Hearers,</hi> as a ſpell or charm hath upon the Serpents who as the moſt malicious of all creatures will bite without Inchantment. Thus <hi>Abigail,</hi> as it were charmed <hi>David</hi> by her ſpeech: And the wiſe Woman of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> by her words of Wiſdom charmed <hi>Joab</hi> and his Army firſt, and then the City, ſo as they laid aſide their Hoſtility on either ſide, and hearkened to reaſon, in not deſtroying a mother City in <hi>Iſrael. Derioſthenes</hi> by his Eloquence did as much among his <hi>Athenians,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, could with his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Weapons</hi> of War among the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> When ſuch as are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are born into, the World, the <pb n="120" facs="tcp:30252:74"/>
Inhabitants thereof would rejoyce if they knew it, as they do, when they may ſit under the ſhadow of their Authority and Government; And therefore when they are taken away by <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> or other <hi>accidents,</hi> they have great reaſon to mourn and be in heavineſs, eſpecially when there is but little hopes, that when theſe are removed, few others are raiſed up, like to ſucceed in their places with the ſame ſpirit and power: As where Cedars are fallen and none but Sycamores are left for future ſervice. As to the firſt part of this Tragedy; we may ſay it is at this day fulfilling amongſt us in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> As for the latter (which is one of the ſaddeſt changes that can befall a People) let them look to it, who are not yet impoſed upon by Babes and Children, or at leaſt need not ſo be, ſeeing they have power to chuſe ſuch as are here deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, if they know where to find them.</p>
                  <p>Now our old Pillars are removing, let us take heed what new ones we put into the Building. An Emperour once ſaid, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:30252:74"/>
                     <hi>Inveni Romans lateritiam, reliqui marmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eam,</hi> which ſhould be the ambition of every good Ruler to mend, not mar the State.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>From the premiſes this Concluſion may be taken up.</p>
                     <p>DOCT. <hi>That it is a ſad preſage of evil times enſuing, when men of worth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of any Church or State, and none to be found fit to ſupply their places.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had been in a very ſad plight when the Earth and the Inhabitants thereof were diſſolved under <hi>Sauls</hi> Government, if there had not been one found to be ſuccentriated after him, who was able to bear up the Pillars of it.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that in all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Earth, ſince the ſad fall of the firſt Monarch of the World, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been written upon all their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; upon the Royal Palaces of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well as the meaneſt Cottages of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30252:75"/>
Peaſants, greater and leſſer Societies have their <hi>Fates</hi> and <hi>Deſtinies</hi> attending them as well as particular <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Families.</hi> It is a long time before ſome of them attain unto their <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, after which they are continually upon the declining hand. The glorious Fabrick in <hi>Nebuchadnezar's</hi> Image ſoon degenerates from an head of Gold, to feet and toes of Iron, and Clay; It was a long time before the <hi>Aſſyrian Provinces</hi> did culminate in that Head of Gold amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who were but one Branch of the Royal Stem, which came by a lineal deſcent from <hi>Sem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> The Government of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> paſſed through <hi>various changes,</hi> before it aroſe to that Grandeur among the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> but after that time, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Generation they became more baſe and vile, till they fell as low as the Earth it ſelf at laſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> (if it be no part of the former Image, as many learned Interpreters think it was not) that will afford another pregnant inſtance of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30252:75"/>
foreſaid Maxime; for after it had once arrived at its higheſt pitch of Glory and Renown in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar,</hi> it continually declined, till it quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves For in all the ſucceeding Emperors times, whatſoever Glory was gained by the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Proweſs, and Wiſdom of their firſt Founders, or chief Leaders in any age, was baſely loſt and waſted by the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate exceſs of Luxury of their degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate followers in the next. But there is no need to repair to Heathen Kingdoms, or States for the evidence of this Truth. For in the Family of <hi>Jacob,</hi> under the Rule and Reign of their former Judges, and ſucceeding Kings, each Generation brought in freſh Examples of Sin and Judgment; their glory and luſtre, was never permanent and laſting above an Age.</p>
                  <p>And as in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their greateſt glory, ſo in his time was laid the firſt Foundation of their following Ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:30252:76"/>And the mighty men of valour in <hi>David's</hi> time, were laid aſide under <hi>Solomon</hi> (which gave an occaſion to the Rebellion of the <hi>Edomites</hi> in the latter end of his Reign) ſo the Honourable Counſellers, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orators that attended his Court, were either over-looked, or neglected in the very beginning of his Succeſſors Reign.</p>
                  <p>And thus it far'd with them ever ſince the firſt planting of the Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that good Land Flowing with Milk and Honey: Soon after the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the Elders, that for a little while ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, aroſe up another Generation that knew not the Lord, nor his great works, and then preſently we read of another ſort of men, that came in place, neither honourable for wiſdom or valour, unleſs now and then when God raiſed up ſome extraordinary perſon, enabling him by extraordinary aſſiſtance, to work their deliverance in a kind of miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: As it is expreſſed in the Triumphant Song of <hi>Deborah;</hi> there was ſcarce a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30252:76"/>
Shield or Spear found amongſt forty thouſand men of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And poſſibly <hi>Shamgar</hi> and <hi>Samſon</hi> obtained thoſe ſignal victories over their Enemies, with ſuch unuſual Weapon, as <hi>Oxe-goods,</hi> and <hi>Aſſes Jaw-bones,</hi> becauſe by the ſlothfulneſs and Luxury of thoſe degenerate times, other Weapons were laid aſide as needleſs, and uſeleſs. Might it not eaſily have been preſaged from ſuch a Generation of men, as either did diſcountenance or diſcourage the cunning Artificers, or men of War, as in <hi>Elies,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Saul's</hi> time, that they were disfurniſhed either of <hi>Smiths</hi> to make, or valiant men to uſe Armour, and Weapons of War, what ruin they were running into, as befel them in the latter end of <hi>Saul's</hi> time?</p>
                  <p>The removal of ſuch men of worth muſt needs be a ſad omen; if either we conſider the neceſſity and uſe of ſuch men or the cauſe of their removal, ſuch are necceſſarily required both to the being and well-being of any People; For they are as eyes to the blind and ignorant as <hi>Moſes</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Ingredient, is <hi>Sagacity,</hi> or a ſpirit of diſcerning, and quickneſs of underſtanding, that makes a man to be fore-ſighted to look into the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralia of a caſe or difficulty; to ſee afar off; to diſcern events in their cauſes, and conſequents in their antecedents, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

ſaith, Prov. 22.3. <hi>The wiſe man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth an evil, and hideth himſelf;</hi> when he that is dull and weak ſighted, paſſes on and is puniſhed. The Lord commended the unjuſt Steward becauſe he had done wiſely, he is not commended for uſing of deceit and falſhood, but for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in foreſeeing the danger of being put out of a Stewardſhip, and having no where to betake himſelf in a time of diſtreſs; ſo it is ſaid, the wiſe mans eyes are in his head, as in the watch Tower to look round about, and diſcern what may be approaching afar off. The fear of the Lord is the beginning or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of this Wiſdom; as tis ſaid of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Servants, upon the threatning of the Hail, <hi>He that feared the Lord made his Servants, and his Cattle flee into the Houſe before hand.

There is in ſome perſons an oracular kind of wiſdom, that they can diſcern the moſt ſecret kind of things, and find out the abſtruſeſt difficulties, whereby they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover the true nature and ſtate of the moſt hidden things.</p>

So did he by a like depth of wiſdom, paſs ſuch a prudent Sentence upon <hi>Shimei,</hi> which though good and favourable in it ſelf, yet was ſo warily circumſtanced that it became a Trap to take an old Sinner in, and bring upon him the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment juſtly due, without breaking <hi>David's</hi> word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another part of wiſdom is to pitch upon the right manner, after the

end is diſcovered; many a man fails in the compaſſing or bringing about the great and main deſign of his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſecurity for lack of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: He that foreſeeth the evils if he doth not betake himſelf to a right ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be overtaken therewith, though he hath foreſeen it: When <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw his wound he ſent to King <hi>Jareb;</hi> ſo did <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but that did not heal or help them, but plunged them further into the depth of their miſery. Suppoſe we have rightly judged of the end, be it an evil to be avoided, that may be like to ruin us; or a good to be deſired to make us happy; if we take an indirect courſe, for the one or the other, we may get a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing or run into a greater miſchief than that which we intended to avoid: He that makes uſe of lawful means, as one ſayes, to bring about an unlawful end, doth as it were put God into the Devils ſervice, as he that does evil, that good may come thereon, puts the Devil into Gods ſervice
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30252:86"/>
both which are abominable. True wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom brings all circumſtances into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which are to be weighed (in the ballance; and what means, with all circumſtances conſidered is the moſt proper to accompliſh the end propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is only to be made uſe of. When the Iron is blunt, wiſdom muſt be had to direct, whether more ſharpneſs in the Inſtrument, or more ſtrength in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent be beſt to be improved: wiſdome muſt teach men when to anſwer a Fool according to his folly, and when not There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to keep ſilence; wiſdome muſt determine by circumſtances, when the the time of the one, or the other is. <hi>Non minus est magna virtus ſcire deſinere quam ſcire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;</hi> Nature teaches all men to do the one, it is wiſdome that teaches ſome men the other. <hi>Huſhai</hi> befooled all <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Counſellors, and under God was the means of defeating <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Counſel, by propounding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableneſs of the time; which was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30252:86"/>
the very hinge on which hung the weight of the whole buſineſs which none of the reſt diſcerned but <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi> Thus a wiſe mans heart diſcerns both time and judgment as well the time when, as the matter, what is to be done. If <hi>Rehoboam</hi> could have ſerved the people but that one time, they would in reaſon have ſerved him for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is a wiſe man that is cautious to redeem the time, as well as to diſcern it. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>they do not walk circumſpectly, as wiſe but as fools that do not redeem the time.</hi> Time, which is one of the preciouſeſt Talents in our hands can never be recalled when once it is paſt. <hi>Poſt eſt occaſio calva.</hi> This is the precipice of Deſtruction where thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are ſhipwreckt becauſe they do not improve their ſeaſon, but act as if they had time lying on their hands, which is the quickeſt commodity in the Market of Eternity, for it paſſes away ſwifter than a Weavers Shuttle, or the

As on the other hand, he that is ſlothful in buſineſs is brother to a great waſter; Through the ſlothfulneſs of the hands the houſe will drop through, and ſo be ruined, as well as if it were pulled down by the hands of fooliſhneſs. The vineyard of the ſlothful is over-run with Thiſtles and Thorns (which with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might have abounded with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits) ſo is the heart of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Profeſſor with luſts of the Fleſh.</p>

The prudent man is no changling: He that orders his affairs with diſcretion, doth not dance up and down like a meteor in the Air, <hi>but his heart is fixed truſting in the Lord:</hi> Thoſe men of old called <hi>Homines quadrati,</hi> that are always ſteady, reſting on their Baſis, and not turning and rowling from one ſide to an other; not like quick-ſilver, running every way, but fixed no where. The reall Starrs that are to lighten the world are alwayes fixed in their own Orb, not like Comets driven about by every new motion from inferiour bodies. <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes the Children of wiſdom <hi>to fear God and the King, and not to meddle with them that are given to change;</hi> that do <hi>ſtudere novis rebus,</hi> that cannot keep their place; that turn up and down for advantage: They that are unſtable as the water were never counted to excel in wiſdom, or any other vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

His wiſdom will not let him be ſlack handed, for thereby he will run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand with his great Creditor: As his diligence maketh him take the fitteſt time wherein to ſow his ſeed early or late, ſo his wiſdom teacheth him ſo much liberality, as not to ſow ſparingly leſt he reap ſparingly; for according to our work ſhall be our Reward. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth ſuggeſt to him, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give than to receive; as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of him that lendeth, is better than of him that borroweth to whom the other is a kind of Servant.

thereby, though his unrighteouſneſs did not commend it as a Duty. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>David</hi> uſes to encourage himſelf and his People to give liberally toward the building of the Temple, was becauſe they were Strangers and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers before God, as all their Fathers were, and their dayes on the Earth were as a ſhadow, and there was no abiding, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.15. As if they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that by reaſon of the brevity of their lives, they could not perpetually enjoy thoſe things that were in their poſſeſſion, they did out of meer devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and piety conſecrate the ſame to him from whom they had received all their Wealth and Eſtate, who they knew out of his meer bounty would requite them with eternal life and glory; there is no abiding of our time upon the earth nor of our riches in our hands, which may take them to their wings, and Fly away as a bird toward Heaven; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſdom teaches them to give while they may. So alſo on the ſame ground
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30252:89"/>
his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes to give to the poor, which will prove but lending to the Lord, who will liberally repay.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wiſdom makes men deliberate, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in their actions, ſedate and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their ſpirits; with the well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed there is wiſdom: They that do things over haſtily, may have too much time to repent afterward. <hi>A man of underſtanding</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>of a Cool,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sedate, Compoſed temper,</hi> not too much over heated with the fire of Anger: <hi>Be not haſty</hi> ſaith he alſo, <hi>to go out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him who hath power to do what he pleaſeth. David</hi> was too ſudden in his determination about <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> caſe; thou and <hi>Zibah</hi> divide the Land, before he had taken ſo much time as to hear the allegations on either ſide: <hi>Audi alteram partem,</hi> i. e. hear the other ſide, was a maxime of wiſdom in antient time. So was that alſo, <hi>Secundoe cogitationes ſunt meliores,</hi> or ſecond thoughts are better; <hi>David</hi> had leiſure enough afterward to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30252:89"/>
repent of his ſudden, raſh command to <hi>Joab</hi> to number the people. The next or ſhorteſt way to the end is not always the beſt and ſafeſt. It is better ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to march about to gain the wind than to fall directly upon the Enemy, as <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Baal-Perazim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So 'twas ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> ſir-named the wiſe, King of <hi>France</hi> overcame our <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third by Policy and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which his Father could not do by all his power.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wiſdom teacheth men to govern their paſſions: our paſſions both of love and hatred are violent, and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, elſe they may endanger the whole man. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them Fools, <hi>who ſuffer anger to reſt in their boſom.</hi> He that lets the Sun go down upon his wrath, may be like to have the Devil for his Bed-fellow, ſaith one. <hi>Samſon's</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in his love, makes him loſe his life and his liberty in the iſſue, many do by their Souls as the Mariners did by their Ship wherein <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed; for ſo loſing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30252:90"/>
Rudder bands of Reaſon they ſpread the Sail of all their power and endeavours, and to commit themſelves to the winds and waves of their paſſions, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently drive them upon the Rocks or Sands, where they ſuffer Ship-wreck of all that is Embarqued. <hi>Abigail</hi> who had been the prudent Wife of a rich Fool, wiſely reproves <hi>David</hi> for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who at other times was counted wiſe as an Angel of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Wiſdom makes men humble and lowly of heart, in imitation of him in whom are hid all the Treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well politically as ſpiritually; for ſo our Saviour convinces the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees of their folly, as well as pride in taking the uppermoſt ſeats at the firſt hand as they come into the Feaſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they had wiſely taken lower Seats at firſt, they might with honour have been advanced, whereas afterwards ſome of them were forced with ſhame to give place to their betters; Wiſe men cannot but ſee great reaſon to be humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30252:90"/>
a double promiſe is annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; both by being advanced by God himſelf, and of being taught by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Therefore ſeeing God himſelf hath made humility the way to honour, he is not a wiſe man that ſhall refuſe to walk therein. A poor and wiſe Child is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before an old and fooliſh King, that is too high to receive an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A wiſe mans head will never be broken by a reproof. Out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the wiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>David</hi> cometh to Reign, when he that (may be) is born Heir to a Kingdom, becometh poor by his Pride, as did <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10 Wiſdom makes men confident and bold, as well as Righteouſneſs; becauſe they truſt in the Lord, and build upon the ſure Foundation of his Word, who is the Rock of Ages. Hence are they called wiſe Builders that build on this Foundation, as they are alſo called wiſe Virgins, that lay ſuch foundation of their hopes, as will bear them up in

                  <p>If theſe be properties of a prudent Man, the greater muſt their loſs needs be who have loſt a Commander, Counſellor, Companion, Husband, Father, Friend or Benefactor ſo qualified; which loſſes God ſometimes brings upon an unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful World to puniſh them for ingratitude; and upon his people to teach them to live by Faith, and not to lean upon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Reeds of humane wiſdom and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.

                  <p>The Globe of the natural World made up of Heaven and Earth, is a fit reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

of the ſtate of the Moral, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional World, and the tranſaction of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs therein, where ſome men are as far exalted above others, as the Heaven is above the Earth; for what makes the viſible Heavens ſo conſpicuous, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious above the opake dark body of the Earth beneath, but the bright glittering Stars with which it is beſpangled, ſome of which are continually ſetting beneath as others are aſcending above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; yet may it ſafely be ſaid, that if all the Stars of the firſt magnitude were withdrawn, Heaven it ſelf would be a leſs glorious Orb, compared with what now it is; even ſo would the ſphere of this lower World be far leſs deſirable, if it were not enlightened with ſome radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Lamps much brighter than others; ſo far do ſome Stars excel others in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>The Saints compared with the reſt of the World; are as the Salt of the Earth, the Lights of the Firmament, the <hi>Pillars</hi> and <hi>Shields</hi> of the Earth.</p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:30252:93"/>They are the Salt of the Earth, that keep others ſweet, and preſerve the World from Putrefaction. Some mens Souls, as one ſaith well, ſerve only for Salt to keep their bodies from ſtinking, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, which they preſently do, as well as their names, as ſoon as their Souls are expired; but the righteous and the wiſe are a ſweet Savour both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dead, and their memory ſhall be bleſſed: Their very lips are as a tree of life, and <hi>as well-ſprings</hi> of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that reveive the <hi>Spirits</hi> of thoſe they converſe with. They are the choice and excellent ones upon the Earth, and keep up the honour of others where they live.</p>
                  <p>They are the lights of the World, that enlighten others by the light of their wiſdom, and refreſh them by the luſtre of their holineſs. Every particular Chriſtian may have light enough for himſelf in his own Family; As a Torch or Candle end, that may ſuffice to guid himſelf in his own ſtation and family,

but theſe are as <hi>Stars</hi> in the firmament of Heaven, that give light to the whole Orb of Church or State where they are placed.</p>
                  <p>They are as the <hi>Pillars</hi> that bear up the Fabrick, and ſupport the whole Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: every particular perſon may be of uſe to fill up the ſides of the building, or as Artifice to adorn the outward ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face thereof; but they are of far more choice and excellent uſe that ſerve as <hi>Pillars,</hi> to bear up the weight of the whole work, without which all would preſently fall to the ground; As hapned in <hi>Ely's</hi> and <hi>Saul's</hi> time, when the Earth and the Inhabitants thereof were diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for want of ſome to bear up the <hi>Pillars</hi> of it.

As may be ſeen by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah,</hi> which flouriſhed and

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30252:96"/>
he neither expreſſed impatience under thoſe grinding pains, nor want of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or comfort from his firſt ſeizure; yea ſuch was his earneſt deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from his Warfare, that he could not be perſwaded to ſay Amen to the earneſt deſires of his beſt and neareſt friends for recovery from his preſent ſickneſs, or for continuance of life any longer: As was ſaid of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Palſgrave of the Rhine, who told his Friends, that came about his ſick-bed, <hi>He had lived long enough for them on earth, it was now time for him to live to himſelf in Heaven.</hi> So having fought the good fight, run his Race, and finiſhed his courſe; he quietly reſigned up his ſpirit to God that gave it. <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labour, and their works follow them.</hi> His laſt thoughts and endeavours were for the good of the publick, as may be ſeen by the <hi>Irenicon</hi> now lately found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Papers, which it is thought would be too much ingratitude to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

from the view of all any longer.</p>
                  <p>If after his death he ſhould meet with that which is common to other men of wiſdom and worth in the world, to be traduced, and hardly cenſured, it would be no wonder. Sore eyes cannot bear the light: Men of corrupt minds and manners are moſt forward to oppoſe the truth and its aſſertors; to ſay he was without infirmities, was to ſay he was not a Man, for there is no juſt man that ſinneth not; yet as they ſay of natural Phiſitians, their Errors are buried in the Church yard, though their Cures are written with the beams of the Sun: if he as a Phyſitian of the ſtate in courſe had any skill above others, let none envy him the honour thereof: if he ever committed any Errors, let them be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him in his Grave, as in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of oblivion. <hi>The memory of the juſt ſhall be bleſſed, who only of all others are aſcended out of the reach of Fate and Corruption.</hi>

be afraid to appear before their Judge: You that are Souldiers, know the laſt Enemy you have to conflict with is death which you can never overcome but by Faith in him who overcame both death, and him that hath the power of Death that is the Devil.

                  <p>Is it not a ſhame and diſhonour to him whoſe followers they pretend to be, or really are, that meer Heathens ſhould out-do them in that point.</p>
                  <p>Some of them could ſay, <hi>Dulce &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum eſt pro patria mori.</hi> The Souldier takes his life in his hand; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner places it in the Planks of his Ship or other brittle Veſſel, without fear of death or danger, upon no other encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, than of fading Honour, or uncertain wealth: why ſhould they that fight under the Banner of Chriſt Jeſus, or are embarqued in his Cauſe, be more afraid to die? who may be aſſured to come off with honour and ſafety at the laſt, and arrive at the Haven of reſt and eternal happineſs in the cloſe of their lives.</p>

                  <p>The wiſe Heathen of old have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made Sleep the image of Death, but with them, the ſimilitude holds not ſo exact a proportion as with us Chriſtians, becauſe of their Ignorance, or at leaſt their uncertain hope of a Reſurrection, and Bleſſedneſs of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life.</p>

for every one in general, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any thing upon the Earth, which is endued with life.</hi> Such conſiderations as theſe the dim light of nature may ſuggeſt to arm us againſt the fear of that our laſt enemy: yet <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> reports of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. a great and politick King of <hi>France,</hi> how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Servants, <hi>That if he were in danger of death, they ſhould only move him to confeſs himſelf, and diſpoſe of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not ſound in his ears the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word</hi> Death, <hi>which notwithstanding he was forced often to hear, and patiently to bear in his laſt ſickneſs, by the Tyrany of his Phiſitian of whom he ſtood in awe:</hi> But real <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who with the Apoſtle, can ſay, <hi>for them to live is Christ,</hi> will ſay, <hi>for them to die is gain.

The like Command have all Chriſtians received from the Captain of their Salvation, alwayes to have their loins girt, and their ſtaves in their hands, <hi>to watch and pray that they enter not into temptation,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30252:103"/>
know not at what time they will come, who have power to require our Souls of her. <hi>In vita vigilent juſti, ideo in morte dicantur dormire,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin,</hi> i. e. The juſt do alwayes watch during the time of this life, Therefore in death, they are ſaid only to ſleep. Watching is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Chriſtian Souldier. What can be more dreadful than to be found unprepared, or unprovided at the laſt Summons? And as another ſpeaks, <hi>Quid facies anima miſerabilis? quo te ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas? comparere erit intolerabile, latere impoſſibile.</hi> That ſoul muſt needs be in a miſerable plunge, that ſhall find it as impoſſible to ly hid, as intolerable to appear. The only way to die hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily is to live holily.

deſtroyed, ſo ſhould we entertain thoſe Meſſengers, whoſe buſineſs only is to take us out of a miſerable and ſinful World, and tranſlate us into the place of Glory. <hi>Speranti grandia mediocria ſunt ingrata:</hi> All things tend to their center. <q>The ſtones toſſed from the Earth, borrow wings to their weighty nature to deſcend beneath, where they have their look. Rivers are touched with amarous curioſity to reviſit their Mother the Sea. The pyramidal flames of fire witneſs they burn, but with deſire only of joyning themſelves with their firſt beginning. Heaven is our center, why ſhould we not be raviſhed to be there, to joyn as Atoms to their unity; as rayes to the body of the light? To ſhew us the way from aloft, thoſe Torches of the night gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly ſhews us their twinkling baits: They ſhine not to us but to ſhew us the way of their azure vaults as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only place of our repoſe, <hi>Mancheſter al Mondo.</hi>

                  <p>THe Excellency of the work of making, or maintaining peace may be gathered from the great reward promiſed by our Saviour to all ſuch, that they ſhall be called the Children of God: And although it be a Duty principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incumbent on the Counſellers and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſaders of peace, yet ſuch is the neceſſity thereof oft times, even in the beſt times of the Church that may encourage any one, and diſcourage none that may have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of dealing therein. It is recorded of old, that not only <hi>Bezaleel and Aholiab</hi> attended to the work of the Tabernacle, who were immediately inſpired, and called of God to that ſervice, but that all who were wiſe in heart willingly offered themſelves thereunto: on which conſiderations, it need be the leſs wondred at, that the Worthy
<pb facs="tcp:30252:107"/>
Gentleman, who Penned the following Eſſay, applied himſelf to ſuch a Service, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the peace of this our Jeruſalem, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his proper Work and Imployment lay in another Spheare. Holy <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that was a Man of War, and expert in that Service, famous for his skill, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs therein, makes this Declaration for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>That he was for Peace, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when he ſpake, were for War.</hi> And indeed they were commanded of God to offer terms of Peace to the worſt of their Enemies (all ſave the <hi>Cananites</hi> that were under the <hi>Anathema</hi>) before they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized a War upon them. Great have been the miſchiefs and miſeries of Diſſention and Strife in the later, as well as former Ages of the Church, which oft times have ended in a kind of War: As in <hi>Germany</hi> the controverſie between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and others, about the Lords Supper, was called <hi>Bellum Sacramentale:</hi> Every one having a ſhare in the common Bottom, whereon we are all Embarqued; it is great pity any endeavours ſhould be omitted to <pb facs="tcp:30252:107"/>
prevent a Shipwreck. They who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above others by the eminency of their Wiſdom and Experience, as well as by the Dignity of their Places, have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantage above the reſt to foreſee Dangers approaching, and cannot do a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice to their Neighbours, than to give them timely notice of the evils im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and of the ſureſt wayes to prevent them. He muſt need be very dull of underſtanding, who doth not obſerve how in our Conſtitution, Difference in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are like to have no ſmall influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Civil Affairs; eſpecially when it is ready to come to ſiding and making of Parties. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> while one ſays <hi>he is of Paul,</hi> another <hi>he is of Apollos,</hi> they are carnal, and walk as men. It is a too apparent ſymptom of a ſpirit of Diſſention prevailing, when men are denominated, or known by others to be of this or that Party, although they ſhould not ſo ſpeak of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner of handling this Subject, by the Author, If the Writings of <pb facs="tcp:30252:108"/>
very learned and judicious men treating thereof, be conſulted withal, it will appear that he hath as diſcreetly laid open the malady growing upon us, and laid down as exact, and compendious a method for a ſuitable Medicine, as any other that hath medled therewith. It was the Obſervation of <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of men, and ſeconded by the experience of all future times, that only by Pride cometh Contention, as it is written by a very learned Pen: And that emulation about wiſdom, wealth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have put the whole Earth into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. This is the root of bitterneſs to all other evils of ſelf-love, malice and envy, of all which Covetouſneſs is an inſeparable companion: and is either chief in the firſt enterprize, or over-rules in carrying on all wayes of commotion. A Diſeaſe when firſt diſcovered, may eaſily be cured, as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians tell us. If that be our caſe at this time, the Receipts propounded in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe ſeem very proper; and if ſeriouſly applied, may with Gods bleſſing be a great help to bring a ſober people into a <pb facs="tcp:30252:108"/>
meet poſture, for obtaining the deſired bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Peace; which the God of all Grace, grant unto this poor People, which have with great coſt, labour and hazard travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo far to enjoy: It is the Apoſtolical Bleſſing, to them that are of one mind, and live in peace, That the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with them.</p>

We need not make ſearch for a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> the Authors and Fomenters of Diſcord in the Chriſtian World, their Father and Maſter, the arch Enemy of Chriſt and his Church needs no ſuch ſubordinate Inſtruments, to work his own ends in our ruine, being warned, we ſhould not be ignorant of his devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; what the red Dragon cannot effect by force and violence, the ſubtile Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will attempt by deceit.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30252:117"/>
Cauſes of our Diſtempers, are. 1. Pride and Self-conceitedneſs, they are rarely ſeparated, every proud man thinks well of himſelf, and commonly better than he deſerves; every wiſe man hath a modeſt Opinion of his own worth, yea can prefer another before himſelf, by Pride comes contention, and an exalted Opinion of a mans own excellencies will make him violent and injurious to any that do oppoſe him, and cannot ſubſcribe his Dictates or admire his worth; Pride like Scum will float up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, muſt have the Wall or juſtle for it; the Moraliſts allow ſome grains of it, to greater <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>acquirements,</hi> at leaſt as tolerable, but in meaner abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties decry it as loathſome and grievous, ſuch as wanting the principles of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and being led by Appetite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which quenches thoſe tender ſparks of reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> hath left them, are like to be very bad diſcerners of truth, but are eaſily deluded into miſtakes. They will be ignorant in nothing; <hi>omne

ſcibile</hi> is ſcarce an adequate object of their knowledge; and in all queſtions and cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, can as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and magiſterially deliver their determinations, as if they profeſſed the chair. The modeſt Dr. <hi>Sibs,</hi> ſpeaketh of ſuch in theſe words; <hi>When blindneſs and boldneſs, ignorance and arrogance, weakneſs and wilfulneſs meet together in one, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men odious to God, it maketh them bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome in ſociety, dangerous in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, troublers of better deſigns, untractable and uncapable of better direction, miſerable in the iſſue; and therefore adviſeth them, to know their parts and place, and not to enterprize any thing above their meaſure, which makes both their perſons and their caſe obnoxious to ſcorn;</hi> But are theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be found among us?

except it be in ſome Paroxiſm, where do men of worth weigh ſo little, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we put our ſelves in the other Scales; though former Education hath not advanced our natural endowments, and our preſent condition calls for all our times and ſpirits to relieve our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, yet the experience of ſome ſlender opportunities of the knowledg of ſome affairs in Church and ſtate hath ſo elevated the conceits of many, that they dare not only vye with, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the judgements of thoſe Grandees whoſe abilities and atchievements all wiſe and ſober men have admired, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> himſelf was but a fool (perhaps a Knave) <hi>Walſingham</hi> and <hi>Burleigh</hi> weak men to them, <hi>Calvin, Ames,</hi> &amp;c. lived in darker times, and ſaw but in part, they arrived not to their attainments, they are <hi>Alboe Gallinoe filii, meliore luto ficti;</hi> is not ſuch a ſpirit amongſt us, doth not this ſpirit laſt to envy and ſtrife, and incite the child to behave himſelf proudly againſt the antient, and

                     <p n="2">2 Ambition and Envy; Coveting of honour to our ſelves and grudging that others are preferred before us, are forcible engenderers of ſtrife and diviſion; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is the root of all evil, Honour is as deſirable to many men as Riches, and poſſibly here more attainable; A man of worth, as they would be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may be an expectant once in the Year, for the one, whenas he may have ſmall hope in his whole life to graſp the other; Ambition is reſtleſs, muſt raiſe commotions, that thereby it might have an opportunity of advancement, and employes envy to depreſs others, that they fancy may ſtand in their way, and will oblige any parties, that may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to their deſign. Thus did <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and his adherents, ſeducing the whole Congregation: and by the ſame Artifice did <hi>Abſolom</hi> draw after him the ten Tribes: They cannot (with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) ſail on a quiet Sea, they deſire and

would raiſe a ſtorm, hoping ſome boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Billow will heave them into the Port, and if it prove a Rock, whereon they are ſhip-wreckt, they doubt not to float on ſhoar with the company, They cannot attend the Philoſophers counſel, <hi>ſorte tua contentus abi,</hi> nor that of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, to abide in the calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are ſet, they cannot ſtay for the bleſſing, nor believe when God hath need of their ſervice, he will find them an employment, whatever ſtands in the way of their deſign, muſt give place, they are reſolved with <hi>Hannibal, aut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am inveniam aut faciam,</hi> though they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often miſcarry; <hi>for the race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battle to the ſtrong, nor favour to men of skill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Cenſoriouſneſs, diſparates, that have divers objects, others and our ſelves thoſe we account our Antagoniſts, and theſe our Friends; we are ſharp-ſighted to obſerve, and eſpy, the errors and lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the one, we exaggerate and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate them, and ſeverely animadvert

Thus we are enamored of our own ſhadows, and can dandle our own Brats, deſpiſing the real worth of others and very evilly in treating their moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious productions; The potency of theſe paſſions we may ſee in <hi>David's, Thou and Ziba divide the Land,</hi> and in his <hi>Deal gently with the young man, even with Abſolom,</hi> prejudiced againſt the faithful <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> by the falſe inſinuations of <hi>Ziba,</hi> indulgent to a treacherous and

varieties of gifts (though not all alike) for your journey, are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? to one is given wiſdom, to another knowledg, by the ſame ſpirit; do not quarrel at this providence, nor queſtion his wiſdom, but as far as we have attained let us walk by the ſame rule, God expects not that we ſhould be <hi>omniſcii,</hi> but that we be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſcii;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt, and him crucified, and have not we ſo learned Chriſt? muſt we revile and laſh our School-fellows as dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and trewants, whoſe proficiencies are not ſo much as ours, nor their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments ſo high? ought we not to leave that care to the Maſter, who beſt knows their capacities? or at leaſt remit it to his Uſhers; our overmuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (which will never procure us thanks) cauſes our trouble. But muſt we not contend for the Faith? and ſtand faſt in it? yes, but not be clamorous, or obſtreperous, reproaching or reviling your Brethren, your Diſputes muſt not
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:30252:121"/>
be as with with Swords and Guns, you muſt not lay more weight upon your notion than it will bear, to highten the difference; nor endeavour to drive it in with a beetle. There are Fundamentals and Superſtructures of Faith and Order, in which we all agree there may be ſome finiſhing work, about which, we are not altogether alike minded, yet no need to pull down the building: Some ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and doubts may remain for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the next Age; <hi>Cum Elias venerit ſolvet nodos:</hi> this having been highly honoured with the diſcovery or clearer manifeſtation of many hidden truths; ſhould we particularly enquire into notions or things wherein we differ, we ſhall find out diſcords, diviſions, debates &amp; animoſities, to be cauſleſs and unreaſonable, Sinful and unchriſtian.</p>
                     <p>For Example, The one affirmeth, no Church Act can paſs without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Elders, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordinarily: the other to affirm the major vote of the Brethren is concuſſiive, and makes a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:30252:122"/>
Church Act though the Elders conſent not. I demand, what damage hath any Church ſuſtained by any Elderſhips act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the firſt opinion, if it be ſaid, ſome proceeding may have been hindred thereby: And may it not be better, that proceedings be forborn when the Guides and Rulers diſſent, with whom doubtleſs, diverſe of the fraternity will concur. And doth not former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter experience ſhew that the diſſent of many leſs conſiderable perſons do much enervate proceedings in Churches, where matters ſhould be carried on, ſweetly, by moral ſuaſion, not deſpoticatly, by imperious determinations; but ſo we may loſe the truth. You may preſerve it in your own heads, but not beat it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. A Paſtor who is called to Baptize as well as to Preach, believes his office obliges him to Baptize in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude larger than your opinion, and may have the judgment of a Synod concurring with his own, ſhall it be a grief to you that he acts according to his own faith?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:30252:122"/>
What cauſe have you to be offended? He is fully perſwaded in his own mind, to the Lord he baptizeth, and for the Lord he doth it, whoſe Miniſter he is, but your Guide, Overſeer and Ruler, and who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant, to his own Maſter let him ſtand or fall, were the caſe doubtful, which I determine not, the rule is, <hi>favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſunt ampliendoe,</hi> better two admitted to whom it doth not belong, then one denyed whoſe right it is.

                     <p>For Council, None of us ſay their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations do bind the particular Churches juridice, ſome ſay they do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, directive, and for order <hi>in foro exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore,</hi> all yeilds they are uſeful for light and help; what need we here contend?
